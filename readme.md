# HViewer: A Laravel-Based Image Gallery
A PHP Laravel-based gallery viewer. Works great with comic books and manga!

[Here's an image gallery of this image gallery application (ironic)](http://imgur.com/a/Aok3y). I'll set up a working website of the application once I have more features implemented.

This web application is still a work in progress and has a long way to go! I will update this readme properly once I have more features added.

## Current Features Implemented:

- [x] Gallery Description Page
- [x] Gallery Viewer
- [ ] Advanced Gallery Viewer Optionns
- [ ] Home Page
- [ ] Archive/Series Page
- [ ] Search Page
- [ ] Advanced Filtering Page
- [ ] User Account Creation and Authentication
- [ ] Favorites Page

List is going to expand with more once the following features are added.
